Syntax highliting for `aqua` programming language

## What is aqua?

Aqua is a new-gen language for distributed systems.

Aqua programs are executed on many peers, sequentially or in parallel, forming a single-use coordination network.

Aqua's runtime is heterogeneous: it includes browsers, servers, devices, all involved in solving a single task. Therefore, Aqua scripts are compiled into several targets at once, with AIR and Typescript as a default.
